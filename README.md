# Honours Project - Exploring Network Latency Compensation and its Effect on User Experience in an Online First-Person Shooter Game

An application created in the Unity game engine using C# for the requirements of my final year Honours Project. The application consists of 3 levels to test the different levels of latency compensation. 

This project can be run by following the steps at: https://github.com/JackOswald/Honours-Project-Player-Test

# What I Learned
 
* Run a master server in Unity and allow other clients to view all active game sessions available to them
* Set up an authoritative server to control the overall state of the game world and perform all world simulations
* Share data between clients and server 
* Implement basic latency compensation and dead reckoning
